# Enhanced `for` Loop for Arrays

With the basic knowledge of traversing arrays using loops, we can look at an alternative `for` loop style that works with arrays to make certain use cases simpler.

This section covers the following material:

- The Need for Enhanced `for` Loops
- Setting Up Enhanced `for` Loop
- Equivalence of `for` and Enhanced `for` Loops
- Drawbacks of Enhanced `for` Loops
    - Not Modifying Elements
    - Lack of Access to Index

To use this repository, start with the `notes.md` document, referencing the various `.java` documents as you go to see the examples in action.

Once you have completed the assignment, save the Java files and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.

# Initial Try

In the `Try.java` file, there is a section of code that is supposed to produce the following output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

It is supposed to do this through an `int` array called `nums` that holds those values, in order, and a `for` loop that iterates through `nums` and prints out each individual value on its own line.

Can you fix the code to properly produce the output above?

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.

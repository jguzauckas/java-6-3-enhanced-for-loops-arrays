# Basics Check

Grade Point Average (GPA) is a standard way to assess a student's overall performance in school. Here is one way to calculate GPA:
- For each class the student is taking, take the grade as a percentage and write it as a decimal from `0.0` for `0%` to `1.0` for `100%`.
- Multiply that decimal for the class by `4.0` (GPA is a score out of `4.0`).
- Average all of these values for the different classes that the student is taking. This average is their GPA.

In `Check.java`, create an array that stores your semester 1 grades from this school year in the decimal form described above. Use array traversal with loops to perform the steps listed above and calculate your GPA, printing out the final result so that it matches the following example output:

```
Your Semester 1 GPA is 3.521.
```
